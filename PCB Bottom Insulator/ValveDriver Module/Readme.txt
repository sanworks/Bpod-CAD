This design is a 3D printable sheet of plastic to fix under the ValveDriver module board. This will insulate the board's bottom-side electrical contacts from short circuits, if the board is accidentally placed on a conductive surface.

Attach the printed sheet with 4 3/8-inch 4-40 screws, and 4-40 lock nuts (McMaster Part# 91831A005). 
For v1 only, a 1/8-inch spacer on each screw is recommended, to enforce a small gap between the plastic and the board.
